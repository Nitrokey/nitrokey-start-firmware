    How can I reflash FST-01 with SWD port?:

Installing newer version of Gnuk onto FST-01 with Gnuk 1.0.1
============================================================

Please note that the feature of firmware upgrade is somewhat
experimental.  I haven't got any success reports yet, but it's only
used by me, so far.  When you will get some failure during your
firmware installation, you will need SWD debugger.  YOU HAVE BEEN
WARNED.  It is best to try firmware upgrade after you get a SWD
debugger.


The firmare upgrade feature of Gnuk
------------------------------------

Gnuk supports firmware upgrade by reGNUal.  It works in the following
steps.

1. User registers RSA public key to Gnuk Token for firmware upgrade

2. When User wants firmware upgrade, user sends
   the GET_CHALLENGE command then the EXTERNAL_AUTHENTICATE command
   to Gnuk Token from host PC to authenticate.
   The EXTERNAL_AUTHENTICATE command message consists of
   signature (of challenge) by corresponding RSA private key.

3. When Gnuk Token receives the EXTERNAL_AUTHENTICATE command message
   and validates signature successfully, Gnuk finishes its normal
   operation and goes to enter mode of loading special program onto RAM.

4. Host PC sends reflashing program (reGNUal) to Gnuk Token.

5. Gnuk clears up all content of flash ROM (but first 4KiB of system)
   at the end of receiving special program and transfers its control
   to reGNUal.

6. reGNUal on Gnuk Token receives new firmware image from host PC and writes
   to each page.

7. Done.


Host PC setting for Gnuk
------------------------

You need proper configuration for permission of Gnuk Token (udev
setting).  It should have lines something like: ::

  # Gnuk Token by FSIJ

  SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ACTION=="add", \
    ATTRS{idVendor}=="234b", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0000", \
    ENV{ID_SMARTCARD_READER}="1", ENV{ID_SMARTCARD_READER_DRIVER}="gnupg"

I have those lines in /etc/udev/rules.d/69-gnuk.rules.


Building another version (newer) of Gnuk
----------------------------------------

Please see README of Gnuk for detail, but it's like configure
and make:  ::

  $ pwd
  /home/user/src/gnuk
  $ cd src
  $ ./configure --vidpid=234b:0000
  $ make

Please take care of configure options.  The default target in 1.0.x
series is Olimex STM32 H103 (not FST-01).  The default target in 1.2.x
is FST-01.

Then you get build/gnuk.elf.

Next, we can get the final image by running following command.

  $ make build/gnuk-vidpid.elf


Invoking configure with FSIJ's USB ID (234b:0000) and generating
gnuk-vidpid.elf means that you are using FSIJ's USB ID (for reGNUal in
this case).  Please note that FSIJ only allows use of its USB ID for
specific situations.  Please read README of Gnuk about that.


Bulding reGNUal
---------------

You need to compile reGNUal. ::

  $ cd ../regnual
  $ make

Then, you should have regnual.bin.  Note that 'configure' of Gnuk
itself is needed before compiling reGNUal.


upgrade_by_passwd.py
--------------------

In the source code distribution of 1.0.4 (or current development
version) of Gnuk, there is a tool named 'upgrade_by_passwd.py'.

This is an easy tool to hide lengthy steps from user and to allow user
firmware upgrade only by password of Gnuk Token.

Before running the script, you need to kill scdaemon: ::

  $ gpg-connect-agent "SCD KILLSCD" "SCD BYE" /bye

The command line invokation above assumes that you properly configure
your environment for Gnuk Token.


How to run the script: ::

  $ cd tool
  $ ./upgrade_by_passwd.py ../regnual/regnual.bin ../src/build/gnuk-vidpid.bin

Then, the script on your host PC invoke the steps described above, and
you will get new version of Gnuk installed.

You can also specify -f option to skip entering your password (it
assumes the factory setting).

If you already have configured another upgrade key installed, you can
specify different slot by -k ``<slot_no>`` option.  SLOT_NO can be 0
to 3.
