* Major changes in Gnuk 1.2.19

  Released 2021-10-12, by NIIBE Yutaka

** KDF Data Object configuration
KDF Data Object should be highly recommended for all configurations.
Nevertheless, for backward compatibillity, in Gnuk 1.2, it is optional
by default; It is up to user to configure KDF Data Object before
importing private keys.  In this situation, it is not good to
introduce new build-time option like --enable-always-require-kdf-do,
because it might wrongly encourage use of Gnuk with no KDF Data Object
setting, by confusion.  If needed, please run configure:

  kdf_do=required ./configure --enable-factory-reset --target...

or

  kdf_do=optional ./configure --enable-factory-reset --target...

Please note that such a use of variable by shell command line is not
well supported by the configure script (for other variables), but
override of kdf_do is needed in some situations.

** Upgrade of Chopstx
We use Chopstx 1.20.  This enables use with PC/SC for GNU/Linux
emulation.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.2.18

  Released 2021-04-02, by NIIBE Yutaka

** GNU/Linux emulation bug fix
This time, for GNU/Linux emulation, KDF Data Object is required before
keygen and key import, really.

** tool/upgrade_by_passwd.py
Now, it checks if the target of binary being written and the
configured target of running device are same.  This check can be
skipped by -s option.  Please note that FST-01 and FST-01SZ are
different target, as it's MHz is different.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.2.17

  Released 2021-02-25, by NIIBE Yutaka

** GNU/Linux: KDF Data Object is required before keygen and key import
For GNU/Linux emulation, KDF Data Object is required before keygen and
key import.

** GNU/Linux emulation
Since 1.2.10, it was not build-able because of MHZ definition.  It is
build-able again, and its USB product string is now "Gnuk Token".  It
has ACK button support using terminal.  It now has start-up message,
and its driver show useful information to setup USBIP.  When no file
for the .gnuk-flash-image file, it is automatically created.

** Removal of tool/gnuk-emulation-setup
Because it is automatically created, the tool is not needed any more.

** Upgrade of Chopstx
We use Chopstx 1.19.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.2.16

  Released 2020-09-10, by NIIBE Yutaka

** New Data Object (Algorithm Information) of OpenPGP card v3.4
The tag is 0x00FA.  This is useful for user interaction to show which
algorithms are supported by the device.

** Ed25519 signing allowing longer message
For OpenPGP, it does hashing on host side before requesting signing to
the device.  Thus, the length of message to be signed is limited and
determined by the hash algorithm.  That's good feature of OpenPGP.  On
the other hand, there is a use case, like OpenSSH certificate signing,
where the length of message is a kind of arbitrary.  Even though Gnuk
(or OpenPGP card protocol itself) has limitation, we removed the
length check against EDDSA_HASH_LEN_MAX at cmd_pso.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.2.15

  Released 2020-01-24, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Switch to Python3
Scripts under tool/ are switched to Python3.
Thanks to Bertrand Jacquin.

** Upgrade of Chopstx
We use Chopstx 1.18.

** Tests also support OpenPGPcard
Now, a test suite under "tests" may be used to OpenPGPcard.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.2.14

  Released 2019-03-05, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Timeout for ACK button support
When a user doesn't acknowledge (> 15 seconds), the operation
timeouts, and authentication state is cleared.

** Upgrade of Chopstx
We use Chopstx 1.14.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.2.13

  Released 2018-12-26, by NIIBE Yutaka

** DFU support and its firmware upgrade fix
DFU support was not well maintained, and firmware upgrade was not
possible for boards with DFU.  Now, at least for Maple Mini, it is
tested.  Note that using Gnuk with DFU on a board is only for an
experiment, because DFU can access the content of flash ROM.  DFU
should be killed by upgrading to normal Gnuk, so that you can have
your private keys.

** Fix for UIF Data Object
When flash ROM is full and coping to new page, UIF DO was not properly
copied.  This bug resulted losing the flag for user interaction.  Now,
it's properly copied, keeping the setting of the feature.

** Upgrade of Chopstx
We use Chopstx 1.13.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.2.12

  Released 2018-11-25, by NIIBE Yutaka

** FST-01SZ fixes
Fixes for Ack button support and serial number.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.2.11

  Released 2018-11-12, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Experimental ACK button support with FST-01SZ
While OpenPGP card specification verison 3 has description for the
"user interaction" button and data objects, there were no
implementation.  To evaluate the feature, experimental support is
added.

** Upgrade of Chopstx
We use Chopstx 1.12, which comes with ACK button driver and supports
FST-01SZ.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.2.10

  Released 2018-05-10, by NIIBE Yutaka

** No inclusion of VID:PID in gnuk-no-vidpid.elf
Now, we have new file named gnuk-no-vidpid.elf with no VID:PID.  The
file gnuk.elf has the VID:PID, like version 1.2.7 or older.

** Upgrade of Chopstx
We use Chopstx 1.9, which supports GD32F103.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.2.9

  Released 2018-04-05, by NIIBE Yutaka

** A test suite fix: Clear PW3
Until 1.2.8, after running the test suite under "tests", PW3 keystring
remained, which affects use of admin-less mode.  New test case is
added to clear PW3.

** tool/upgrade_by_passwd.py supports KDF-DO auth
With KDF-DO, firmware upgrade didn't work.  Now, it's supported.

** Add "single-salt" support for KDF-DO
With KDF-DO, "admin-less" mode didn't work well.  With new feature of
"single-salt" support, we can use "admin-less" mode with KDF-DO.

** factory-reset deletes all upgrade public keys
By card-edit/factory-reset by GnuPG, it deletes all upgrade public
keys, now.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.2.8

  Released 2018-01-23, by NIIBE Yutaka

** No inclusion of VID:PID in gnuk.elf

Distribution of binary image with VID:PID would violate vendor ID
agreement to USB Forum.  Now, we have new file named gnuk-vidpid.elf
for flashing.  The file gnuk.elf can be used to generate
gnuk-vidpid.elf and we can check if it is reproducible or not.

** Passphrase length check

Now, Gnuk checks length of passphrase if it's too short when
changing passphrase.

** Remove unused DEK with BY_ADMIN

For admin-less mode, DEK by OPENPGP_CARD_INITIAL_PW3 remained on flash
ROM.  This could be considered a backdoor, if some other person had or
kept access to the flash ROM, cheating a user.  Now, the DEK is
cleared by zero when the token is set to admin-less mode.

** Upgrade of Chopstx
We use Chopstx 1.8.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.2.7

  Released 2017-11-26, by NIIBE Yutaka

** reGNUal
reGNUal enables CRC module by itself.

** Flash update change
CRC module is disabled when Gnuk stops.  It's reGNUal which needs to
enable CRC module.

** Support of USB suspend
USB suspend and wakeup event are now handled.

** KDF-DO support and KDF by host
KDF-DO is now available.  Host can use this feature.

** Upgrade of Chopstx
We use Chopstx 1.6.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.2.6

  Released 2017-10-11, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Port to GNU/Linux emulation
We can "run" Gnuk Token on GNU/Linux by emulation through USBIP.

** Upgrade of Chopstx
We use Chopstx 1.5.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.2.5

  Released 2017-08-11, by NIIBE Yutaka

** "factory-reset" fix
Gnuk's behavior was implemented by referring the gpg implementation.
It found that gpg implementation was not good from the viewpoint of
the OpenPGP card specification.  GnuPG was fixed to match the OpenPGP
card specification already.  Thus, Gnuk is now fixed.

** Upgrade of Chopstx
We use Chopstx 1.4.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.2.4

  Released 2017-05-12, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Flash ROM security fix
The partial content of flash ROM might be exposed when scanning of
data object had a problem.  Added boundary check and changed layout of
flash ROM.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.2.3

  Released 2017-02-02, by NIIBE Yutaka

** ECC key generation on the device
Bug fixed.

** Upgrade of Chopstx
We use Chopstx 1.3.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.2.2

  Released 2016-10-15, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Change of SELECT FILE behavior 
Gnuk used to reply AID upon SELECT FILE command.  Now, to be compatible
to original OpenPGP card, it returns nothing but status code of 9000.

** Added feature of Factory Reset as compile time option
Original OpenPGP card has the feature, and Gnuk is now configurable to
support the feature.

** Upgrade of Chopstx
We use Chopstx 1.2.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.2.1

  Released 2016-07-11, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Upgrade of Chopstx
We use Chopstx 1.1.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.2.0

  Released 2016-05-20, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Upgrade of Chopstx
We use Chopstx 0.11.

** Support authentication status reset by VERIFY command.
This feature is described in the OpenPGPcard specification V2.2 and
V3.1, which allow user to reset authentication status.

** S2K algorithm tweak to defeat "copycat" service of MCU.
Even if the existence of some services copying MCU, your private key
will not be controled by others, in some cases.

** Bug fix for secp256k1 and NIST P-256.
Bugs in basic computation were fixed.

** Bug fix for bignum routines.
Bignum routine update from upstream (failure doesn't occur for our RSA
computation, though).  Another fix for mpi_exp_mod.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.1.9

  Released 2015-09-18, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Bug fix for Ed25519 and Curve25519
When registering key, wrong operations were not detected correctly.
This is fixed.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.1.8

  Released 2015-09-17, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Upgrade of Chopstx
We use Chopstx 0.10, which supports Nitrokey-Start.

** Card serial number
The way to determine a serial number of Gnuk Token for card has been
changed.  It uses the 96-bit unique bits of MCU, but the portion for
use is changed.

** USB Reset handling
USB reset lets Gnuk Token restart.  It would not be perfect, when it's
during computation of some function, but most parts are protected by
Chopstx's feature of cancellation.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.1.7

  Released 2015-08-05, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Upgrade of Chopstx
We use Chopstx 0.08, which supports STM32 Nucleo and ST Dongle.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.1.6

  Released 2015-07-21, by NIIBE Yutaka

** USB SerialNumber String
The way to determine a serial number of Gnuk Token has been changed.
It uses the 96-bit unique bits of MCU, but the portion for use is
changed.

** Upgrade of Chopstx
We use Chopstx 0.07, which supports STM32 Primer2 and CQ STARM, too.

** Experimental Curve25519 support.

Gnuk can support Curve25519 (for decryption).  Note that this is
pretty much experimental, and subjects to change.  The low level code
is somehow stable, but there are no consensus in higer level.
Especially, OID in the key attribute would be changed in future.

** No --enable-keygen option
It is now standard feature included always.  Note that it doesn't mean
this feature is stable now.  It is becoming stable, hopefully.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.1.5

  Released 2015-06-03, by NIIBE Yutaka

** upgrade_by_passwd.py is not so noisy any more.
Since it's getting stable, no debug output any more.

** Maple mini support.
Although its random number generation is not tested, Maple mini
support is added.

** Windows interoperability fix.
1.1.x (0 to 4) didn't work with Windows because of INTERRUPT transfer.
It's fixed and it works now.

** OpenPGPcard specification v3.0 compatibility.
OpenPGPcard specification v3.0 now include NIST curves (and other
curves) and ECDSA and ECDH operations are defined.  Gnuk follows
this specification.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.1.4

  Released 2014-12-15, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Experimental RSA-4096 support.
Although it takes too long (more than 8.7 second), RSA-4096
is now implemented.

** ECDH support.
ECDH is now supported.  You need development branch (master)
of GnuPG to use this feature.

** ECDSA and EdDSA is not that experimental.
You don't need to edit DEFS variable in src/Makefile.

** STM8S_DISCOVERY is not supported any more.
It's flash ROM size (64KiB) is a bit small to have all features of
Gnuk now.  If you manually edit code to limit the size of executable,
it still could run Gnuk, though.

** configure's default target is now FST-01.
Receiving reports from those who complain default target, I
reconsidered.  Those who has Olimex STM32 H103 usually has JTAG
debugger, while FST-01 users don't.  So, to be safe, the default
target is now FST-01, instead of Olimex STM32 H103.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.1.3

  Released 2014-04-16, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Experimental EdDSA support.
After configure, you can edit the DEFS variable in src/Makefile, so
that Gnuk can support EdDSA with Ed25519 (for authentication).  Note
that this is pretty much experimental, and subjects to change.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.1.2

  Released 2014-03-07, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Experimental ECC support for secp256k1.
After configure, you can edit the DEFS variable in src/Makefile, so
that Gnuk can support ECDSA with NIST P256 (for authentication), and
ECDSA with secp256k1 (for signature).  Note that this is pretty much
experimental, and subjects to change.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.1.1

  Released 2013-12-25, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Tools and test suite now work with PyUSB 1.0, too.
It only worked with PyUSB 0.4.3, but it works with PyUSB 1.0 too.

** Improved RSA routine
Working memory for RSA computation is taken from stack instead of
malloc (mostly).


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.1.0

  Released 2013-12-20, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Overriding key import / generation (Incompatible Change)
Gnuk supports overriding key import or key generation even if keys are
already installed.  Note that it will result password reset of user.

** RSA key generation improvement
Prime number generation is done by Fouque-Tibouchi method.

** Security fix for RSA computation 
PolarSSL had a vulnerability against timing attack.  For detail,
please see:

  http://www.gniibe.org/memo/development/gnuk/polarssl/polarssl-rsa-blinding

** Improved RSA routine
RSA computation has been improved using MPI square routine.  Note that
you should not adopt this modification for general purpose computer,
as this change is weak against the Yarom/Falkner flush+reload cache
side-channel attack.

** Upgrade of NeuG
The true random number generator was upgraded to the one of NeuG 1.0.

** Replacement of kernel (thread library)
Instead of ChibiOS/RT, we now use Chopstx.

** Removal of obsolete features
The feature named pin-dial, which is pin input with hardware
enhancement (with rotary encoder) is removed.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.0.4

  Released 2013-03-15, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Relocatable reGNUal, really 
In 1.0.3, reGNUal was not fully relocatable.  It worked loaded on higher
address, but didn't work for lower address.  This was fixed.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.0.3

  Released 2013-03-14, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Relocatable reGNUal
The upgrade helper, reGNUal, is now relocatable (other than the first
vector table).  It runs well when loaded at different address.  This
makes the upgrade procedure more stable.

** Compilation by newer GNU Toolchain
Now, Gnuk can be compiled with newer GNU Toolchain, specifically GCC
4.7.x and GNU Binutils 2.22.  Old versions of Gnuk had problem for
ChibiOS_2.0.8/os/ports/GCC/ARMCMx/cmsis/core_cm3.c, which was fixed.

** Data object 0x0073
Data object 0x0073 is now available.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.0.2

  Released 2013-02-15, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Product string is now "Gnuk Token" (was: "FSIJ USB Token")
Since the USB ID Repository suggests not including vendor name
in product string, we changed the product string.

** New tool (experimental): test/upgrade_by_passwd.py
This is the tool to install new firmware to Gnuk Token, provided
that it's just shipped from factory (and nothing changed).  It
authenticate as admin by factory setting, register a public key
for firmware upgrade, and then, does firmware upgrade.

** tool/gnuk_upgrade.py supports '-k' option
It now supports RSA key on the host PC (not the one on the Token).

** New tool: tool/get_raw_public_key.py
This is a script to dump raw data of RSA public key, which is useful
to register to Gnuk Token as a firmware upgrade key.

** New tool: tool/gnuk_remove_keys_libusb.py
This tool is libusb version of gnuk_remove_keys.py.  Besides, a bug in
gnuk_remove_keys.py was fixed.

** CCID protocol fix
When time extension is requested by Gnuk Token to host PC, argument
field was 0, which was wrong (but it works for most PC/SC
implementations and GnuPG internal driver).  Now it's 1, which means
1*BWT.

** OpenPGP card protocol enhancement
Now, VERIFY command accepts empty data and returns remaining trial
counts, or 0x9000 (OK) when it's already authenticated.  This is
useful for application to synchronize card's authentication status.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.0.1

  Released 2012-08-03, by NIIBE Yutaka

** USB SerialNumber String
In 1.0, it has a bug for USB SerialNumber String.  It has been fixed
in 1.0.1.


* Major changes in Gnuk 1.0

  Released 2012-07-21, by NIIBE Yutaka

This is bug fixes only release.


* Major changes in Gnuk 0.21

  Released 2012-07-06, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Test suite
A functinality test suite is added under test/ directory.

** New tool: stlinkv2.py
This tool is SWD flash ROM writer with ST-Link/V2.

** New tool: usb_strings.py
This tool is to dump USB strings, which include revision detail and config
options.

** Protection improvement (even when internal data is disclosed)
Even if PW1 and PW3 is same, content of encrypted DEK is different
now.


* Major changes in Gnuk 0.20

  Released 2012-06-19, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Key generation feature added
Finally, key generation is supported.  Note that it may be very slow.
It may take a few minutes (or more) to generate two or three keys,
when you are unlucky.

** DnD pinentry support is deprecated
Once, DnD pinentry was considered a great feature, but it found that
it is difficult to remember moves of folders.

** gnuk_upgrade.py assumes using another token for authentication
Use of another token for authentication is assumed now.  This is
incompatible change.  Note that when you upgrade a token of version
0.19 to 0.20 (or later), you need gnuk_upgrade.py of version 0.19.

** KDF (Key Derivation Function) is now SHA-256
Keystring is now computed by SHA-256 (it was SHA1 before).

** Protection improvements (even when internal data is disclosed)
Three improvements.  (1) Even if PW1 and Reset-code is same, content
of encrypted DEK is different now.  (2) DEK is now encrypted and
decrypted by keystring in ECB mode (it was just a kind of xor by
single block CFB mode).  (3) Key data plus checksum are encrypted in
CFB mode with initial vector (it will be able to switch OCB mode
easily).

** LED display output change
LED display output by Gnuk is now more reactive.  It shows status code
when it gets GET_STATUS message of CCID.  When you communicate Gnuk by
internal CCID driver of GnuPG (instead of PC/SC), and enable
'debug-disable-ticker' option in .gnupg/scdaemon.conf, it is more
silent now.


* Major changes in Gnuk 0.19

  Released 2012-06-06, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Firmware upgrade feature
Firmware upgrade is now possible after the public key authentication
using EXTERNAL AUTHENTICATE command of ISO 7816.  Firmware upgrade is
done together with reGNUal, the firmware upgrade program.

** System service blocks at the beginning of flash ROM.
Once flash ROM is protected, first 4-KiB cannot be modified.  Gnuk
use this area for "system service".  Note that this area will not
be able to be modified by firmware upgrade (or by any method).

** New tool: gnuk_upgrade.py
The tool gnuk_upgrade.py is to do public key authentication using
gpg-agent and send reGNUal to Gnuk.  Then, we put new Gnuk binary
into the device with reGNUal.

** USB strings for revision detail, configure options, and system service.
USB strings now have more information.  There are revision detail
string, configure options string, system service version string, as
well as vendor string and product string.  These strings could be
examined to check Gnuk Token.


* Major changes in Gnuk 0.18

  Released 2012-05-15, by NIIBE Yutaka

** New mandatory option '--vidpid' for configure
You must specify USB vendor ID and product ID for Gnuk.
The file GNUK_USB_DEVICE_ID lists valid USB device IDs.

** New tool: gnuk_remove_keys.py
The tool gnuk_remove_keys.py is to remove all keys in Gnuk Token
and reset PW1 and RC (if any).

** New USB stack
Gnuk used to use USB stack of USB-FS-Device_Lib by ST.  Now, it has
original implementation.  Hopefully, size and quality are improved.


* Major changes in Gnuk 0.17

  Released 2012-02-02, by NIIBE Yutaka

** USB CCID/ICCD protocol implementation change
Gnuk now only supports short APDU level exchange, not supporting
extended APDU level exchange.  Thus, Gnuk could be compatible to older
host side software implementation.

** ISO 7816 SELECT command behavior is somewhat strict now
Old implementations do not check DF name for SELECT command.
This causes some trouble when Gnuk Token is identified as if it were
different card/token.  Now, DF name of OpenPGP card is checked.

** USB CCID/ICCD low-level bug is fixed
When the size of command APDU data is just 49, the lower level packet
size is 64.  This is maximum size of BULK-OUT transfer packet, and
caused trouble in the past implementations.  Example is setting url
(0x5f50) as: http://www.gniibe.org/adpu-string-size-is-just-49
This is because the past implementations expect ZLP (zero length
packet).  Now, it has been fixed.  You can use any size of string.

** CERT.3 Data Object (0x7f21) is now optional
As there's no valid use case for this data object and it does not
work as current version of GnuPG, this is now optional feature.
You can enable this data object by specifying --enable-certdo at
configure time.

** With DnD pinentry, user can cancel pin input
Now, user can cancel pin input by unmounting device before finishing
DnD.

** New tool: pinpadtest.py
The tool pinpadtest.py is PC/SC test tool for pinentry of pinpad with
OpenPGP card v2.


* Major changes in Gnuk 0.16

  Released 2011-12-14, by NIIBE Yutaka

** DnD pinentry support is added and it's default to pinentry support
DnD pinentry support doesn't require any hardware extension, but
emulates mass storage class device of USB.  User inputs pass phrase
by "drag and drop"-ing folders using file manager or something.

** Bug fix for VERIFY for CHV2
With no keys, VERIFY command for CHV2 used to fail even if pass phrase
is correct.  It was intentional, because CHV2 verification would be
useless with no keys.  But there is a corner case for PRIVATE-DOs,
which may requires CHV2 verification.  Even though Gnuk doesn't
support any PRIVATE-DOs, it is good to be fixed.

** Changed bcdUSB = 1.1
Gnuk device conforms to USB 2.0 full speed device, but when it was
2.0, some OS informs users, "you can connect the device to 2.0
compliant hub so that it can have better bandwidth", which is not
the case for full speed device.


* Major changes in Gnuk 0.15

  Released 2011-11-24, by NIIBE Yutaka

** New targets: FST_01 and FST_01_00
Flying Stone Technology's open hardware, Flying Stone Tiny 01 is
supported.

** Flash writing tool for "DfuSe" is improved
Now, it supports holes and unaligned blocks in hex file.

** Experimental PIN-pad support (by TV controller) change
Now, Gnuk has codetables for conversion from CIR code to ASCII code.
Note that only four controllers (of Dell, Sharp, Sony, and Toshiba)
are supported and tested.

** It is possible for users to keep using OPENPGP_CARD_INITIAL_PW1
With a bug fix of verify_user_0, it's now possible.  Although it's not
recommended.

** Important bug fix and a workaround
In version 0.14, __main_stack_size__ (for interrupt handler) was too
small for some cases.  This is fixed in 0.15.

In src/Makefile.in, added -mfix-cortex-m3-ldrd for correctly linking C
library for thumb2.  This is needed for newer summon-arm-toolchain.


* Major changes in Gnuk 0.14

  Released 2011-10-07, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Random number generator change
NeuG, Gniibe's True RNG implementation for STM32F103, has been
integrated to Gnuk.  It is not needed to put random number bytes
(generated by host) to Token any more.


* Major changes in Gnuk 0.13

  Released 2011-06-15, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Improved RSA routine.
About 20% speed improvement.

** New tool: hub_ctrl.
It is a Python implementation ported from original C implementation.
It is useful for development of USB target if you have a good hub.
You can power off/on the port to reset Gnuk Token.


* Major changes in Gnuk 0.12

  Released 2011-05-13, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Admin-less mode is supported.
The OpenPGP card specification assumes existence of a security officer
(admin), who has privilege to manage the card.  On the other hand,
many use cases of Gnuk are admin == user.

Thus, Gnuk now supports "admin-less" mode.  In this mode, user can get
privilege with the password of PW1.

At the initialization of the card, Gnuk becomes compatible mode by
setting PW3.  Without setting PW3, it becomes "admin-less" mode
by setting PW1.

** Important two bug fixes.
Gnuk (<= 0.11) has a bug which makes possible for attacker to change
user password to unknown state without knowing original password (when
no keys are loaded yet).  No, attacker could not steal your identity
(cannot sign or decrypt), but it would be possible to disturb you.

Gnuk (<= 0.11) has a bug which makes possible for attacker to guess
admin password easily.  When admin password is not set (the default
value of factory setting), failure of VERIFY doesn't increment error
counter in older versions.  Observing no increment of error counter,
attacker could know that admin password is the one of factory setting.

** tool/gnuk_put_binary.py now uses pyscard.
Instead of PyUSB, it uses Python binding of PC/SC.  PyUSB version is
still available as tool/gnuk_put_binary_libusb.py.

** Logo for Gnuk is updated.

** Gnuk Sticker SVG is available.


* Major changes in Gnuk 0.11

  Released 2011-04-15, by NIIBE Yutaka

This is bug fixes only release.


* Major changes in Gnuk 0.10

  Released 2011-02-10, by NIIBE Yutaka

** The executable can be installed to multiple devices.
So far, users of Gnuk should have not shared single executable among
multiple devices because the executable includes random bits (or
fixed serial number).  Now, random_bits and fixed serial number are
configured *after* compilation, we can install single executable image
to multiple devices.  Note that we need to configure random_bits for
each device.

** Removed configure option: --with-fixed-serial
It is not compile time option any more.  After installation, we can
modify serial number in AID by tool/gnuk_put_binary.py.  Modification
is possible only once.  If you don't modify, Gnuk uses unique chip ID
of STM32 processor for AID.


* Major changes in Gnuk 0.9

  Released 2011-02-01, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Card Holder Certificate is supported (still this is experimental).
Gnuk can support card holder certificate now.  Note that GnuPG is not
ready yet.  The tool/gnuk_update_binary.py is for writing card holder
certificate to Gnuk Token.

** Better interoperability to OpenSC.
Gnuk is not yet supported by OpenSC, but it could be.  With the
changes in Gnuk, it could be relatively easily possible to support
Gnuk Token by OpenSC with a few changes to libopensc/card-openpgp.c,
and libopensc/pkcs15-openpgp.c.

** New board support "STBee"
STBee is a board by Strawberry Linux Co., Ltd., and it has
STM32F103VET6 on the board.  The chip is High Density CPU with 512KB
flash memory and many I/O.  If you want to connect sensor, display,
etc., this board would be a good candidate.

** Experimental PIN-pad modification(unblock) support is added.
PIN-pad modification(unblock) is supported.


* Major changes in Gnuk 0.8

  Released 2011-01-19, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Experimental PIN-pad modification support is added.
PIN input using rotally encoder and push switch is tested with STBee
Mini.  By this hardware, PIN-pad modification is supported.


* Major changes in Gnuk 0.7

  Released 2011-01-15, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Bug fix only.
In version 0.6, a severe bug was introduced in usb-icc.c when adding a
work around for libccid 1.3.11.  The fix is one-liner, but it is worth
to release newer version.


* Major changes in Gnuk 0.6

  Released 2011-01-14, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Experimental PIN-pad support is added.
Local PIN-pad input is suppored for boards which have input hardware.
PIN input using consumer IR receive module is tested with STBee Mini
and STM8S Discovery.

** USB device serial number is virtually unique now.
STM32F103 has 96-bit unique chip identifier.  We take advantage of
this, Gnuk Token has virtually unique USB serial number.

** Card serial number is determined at run time by chip identifier.
Until version 0.5, card serial number was compile time option.  If we
used same binary for different devices, card serial number was same.
Now, we use STM32F103's 96-bit unique chip identifier for card serial
number (when you don't use --with-fixed-serial option).

** More improved USB-CCID/ICCD implementation.
The changes in 0.5 was not that good for libccid 1.3.11, which has
small buffer (only 262-byte APDU).  Workaround for libccid 1.3.11 is
implemented.


* Major changes in Gnuk 0.5

  Released 2010-12-13, by NIIBE Yutaka

** LED blink
LED blink now shows status output of the card.  It shows the status of
CHV3, CHV2, and CHV1 when GPG is accessing the card.

** New board support "STM8S Discovery"
ST-Link part (with STM32F103C8T6) of STM8S Discovery board is now supported.

** Digital signing for SHA224/SHA256/SHA384/SHA512 digestInfo is now possible.

** Fixes for password management
Now, you can allow the token to do digital signing multiple times with
single authentication.  You can use "forcesig" subcommand in card-edit
of GnuPG to enable the feature.

** Key management changes
If you remove all keys, it is possible to import keys again.

** More improved USB-CCID/ICCD implementation.
Gnuk works better with GPG's in-stock protocol stack.  You can do
digital signing (not decryption, key import, or get_public_key in
GPG2).  For decryption, key import and get_public_key, changes are
needed for GPG (scd/ccid-driver.c) to support the case of extended
APDU.  In short, you can sign with Gnuk by GPG.

** Windows support.
Gnuk Token could run with GPG4WIN on MS Windows.  GPG4WIN runs with
"usbccid" driver and "winscard" driver.


* Major changes in Gnuk 0.4

  Released 2010-11-09, by NIIBE Yutaka

** New board support "STBee Mini".

** Flash writing tool for "DfuSe" is included now.

** Since Flash GC is now implemented, it can be used longer.


* Major changes in Gnuk 0.3

  Released 2010-10-23, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Now we have 'configure' script to select target.

** Support system with DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade) downloader.

** New board support "CQ STARM".

** Improved USB-ICCD implementation.  Works fine with GPG's protocol stack.


* Major changes in Gnuk 0.2

  Released 2010-09-13, by NIIBE Yutaka

** With DEBUG=1, timeout is more than 3 seconds.

** Flash ROM entries for random numbers are cleared after use. 

** Board support "STM32 Primer 2" now works.
