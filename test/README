This is functionality test suite for Gnuk.

You need python-nose, python-freshen as well as python-usb.

Besides, python-crypto is needed when you use generate_keys.py to
update contents of *.key.


Type:

  $ nosetests --with-freshen

or

  $ nosetests -v --with-freshen

to run the test suite.

To skip tests for key generation, add an option "--tag ~keygen".  To
stop running tests after the first error or failure, add "--stop option".
